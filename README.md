Whats next:

1. Create duty modal: 
    - Auto close datepicker after date selection
    - Manual date entry
2. Insert Duties from Modal into database
3. Filter duties on roster page to show only duties from users of the same group (i.e. Captains only see Duties posted by other Captains etc.)
4. Add filters to roster page 
    - Filter by Departure Location
    - Arrival Location





X. At some point add a function to only swap multiple duties at once. Some sort of linking of duties will be necessary.
