Whats next:

[‚úî]1. Update duty modal: 
    - Auto close datepicker after date selection
    - Manual date entry
[ ]2. Insert Duties from Modal into database
[ ]3. Filter duties on roster page to show only duties from users of the same group (i.e. Captains only see Duties posted by other Captains etc.)
[ ]4. Add filters to roster page 
    - Filter by Departure Location
    - Arrival Location

What am I currently doing: 
- Adding admin role with admin dashboard permissions
    - Focusing on the problems that may arise by giving a user both admin and regular UserRole (i.e. FIRST_OFFICER)

    -CHECK THE APP/API/AUTH/REGISTER ROUTE FOR ADMIN AND BASE SELECTION !!!

    
- Creating an admin dashboard ( preferably check shadcnui dashboard example)



X. At some point add a function to only swap multiple duties at once. Some sort of linking of duties will be necessary.

# CrewSwap UX Improvement Tasks

## Overview
CrewSwap is an aviation crew duty management system that enables crew members to manage flight assignments and swap duties with colleagues. This document outlines potential features and UX improvements to enhance the platform.

## üéØ High Priority UX Improvements

### 1. Real-time Updates & Notifications
**Current Issue**: Users must manually refresh to see new swap requests or duty changes
**Solution**: 
- Implement WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Add push notifications for critical events
- Show notification badges with unread count in header
- Add toast notifications for immediate feedback

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Add Socket.io or similar for real-time updates
// Create notification service with event listeners
// Update UI components to subscribe to real-time events
```

### 2. Advanced Search & Filtering
**Current Issue**: No way to search or filter duties/swap requests
**Solution**:
- Add global search bar in header
- Implement filters for:
  - Date ranges
  - Flight numbers
  - Destinations
  - Crew members
  - Duty status
- Add saved filter presets

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Add search API endpoints with query parameters
// Create reusable FilterPanel component
// Implement debounced search input
```

### 3. Calendar View for Duties
**Current Issue**: Roster view is limited to horizontal scroll
**Solution**:
- Add monthly calendar view option
- Show duties as events on calendar
- Color-code by duty type/status
