Whats next:

[‚úî]1. Update duty modal: 
    - Auto close datepicker after date selection
    - Manual date entry

[ ]2. Change the duty structure:
    [ ] - Instead of flat hierarchy, create a "Duty pairing" structure. Check below!!
    [ ] - Update duty Modal to allow entry of multiple legs.
    [ ] - Update duty Modal to allow "linking" of duties, that have to be swapped together.

[ ]3. Insert Duties from Modal into database

[‚úî]4. Filter duties on roster page to show only duties from users of the same group (i.e. Captains only see Duties posted by other Captains etc.)
[ ]5. Add filters to roster page 
    - Filter by Departure Location
    - Arrival Location
    - Layover or not layover.




To be done later: 
[‚úî] 1. Adding admin role with admin dashboard permissions   
[‚úî] 2. Creating an admin dashboard ( preferably check shadcnui dashboard example)
    [ ]- Add functionality to admin dashboard. 
    [ ]- Add user management to admin dashboard. 
    [ ]- Add duty management to admin dashboard. 
    [ ]- Add debug log viewer. 
[ ] 3. Add layover designator to roster page. 
    [ ] - Roster page will have layovers marked with a line like in regular roster.

[ ] 4. Add roster parser python script to site. 
    [ ] - Script will parse a roster file and insert the duties into the duty modal. 
        [ ] - A select duty modal will be opened for each duty that should be added to the staging modal.
            [ ] - A list view of the duties is ideal initially. 

    

X. At some point add a function to only swap multiple duties at once.
    I.e. only mark a full layover as swappable.
    Some sort of linking of duties will be necessary. 


XX. Translate parser from python to TypeScript.


Duty Pairing structure:
{
  "id": "pairing456",
  "pairingId": "P456", // Or some other identifier for the whole trip
  "startDate": "2025-07-15",
  "endDate": "2025-07-17",
  "totalDuration": "48h 30m",
  "legs": [
    {
      "id": "leg1",
      "flightNumber": "BA2490",
      "date": "2025-07-15",
      "departureTime": "2025-07-15T09:00:00Z",
      "arrivalTime": "2025-07-15T11:30:00Z",
      "departureLocation": "LHR",
      "arrivalLocation": "FCO"
    },
    {
      "id": "layover1",
      "type": "layover", // You can explicitly define layovers
      "location": "FCO",
      "duration": "26h 0m"
    },
    {
      "id": "leg2",
      "flightNumber": "BA2491",
      "date": "2025-07-16",
      "departureTime": "2025-07-16T13:30:00Z",
      "arrivalTime": "2025-07-16T15:00:00Z",
      "departureLocation": "FCO",
      "arrivalLocation": "LHR"
    }
  ]
}

# CrewSwap UX Improvement Tasks

## Overview
CrewSwap is an aviation crew duty management system that enables crew members to manage flight assignments and swap duties with colleagues. This document outlines potential features and UX improvements to enhance the platform.

## üéØ High Priority UX Improvements

### 1. Real-time Updates & Notifications
**Current Issue**: Users must manually refresh to see new swap requests or duty changes
**Solution**: 
- Implement WebSocket connection for real-time updates
- Add push notifications for critical events
- Show notification badges with unread count in header
- Add toast notifications for immediate feedback

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Add Socket.io or similar for real-time updates
// Create notification service with event listeners
// Update UI components to subscribe to real-time events
```

### 2. Advanced Search & Filtering
**Current Issue**: No way to search or filter duties/swap requests
**Solution**:
- Add global search bar in header
- Implement filters for:
  - Date ranges
  - Flight numbers
  - Destinations
  - Crew members
  - Duty status
- Add saved filter presets

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Add search API endpoints with query parameters
// Create reusable FilterPanel component
// Implement debounced search input
```

### 3. Calendar View for Duties
**Current Issue**: Roster view is limited to horizontal scroll
**Solution**:
- Add monthly calendar view option
- Show duties as events on calendar
- Color-code by duty type/status
- Enable drag-and-drop for swap requests
- Add week/month/year view toggles

```typescript
// Integrate react-big-calendar or similar
// Create calendar event adapters for duties
// Add view persistence in localStorage
